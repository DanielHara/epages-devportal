Automated testing is one of the most important aspects of software development.
You can test your code in different ways and on several levels, the most relevant of which are unit testing and integration testing.
On the one hand, in unit testing, you test each one of your functions and components individually.
On the other, in integration testing, you test how all those work along with each other to deliver all the fancy features you offer your users.

As AdriÃ  Fontcuberta pointed out at his remarkable talk at the dotJS conference in Paris (check out this [blog post](/blog/events/dotjs-2019-in-paris-from-the-perspective-of-a-frontend-designer/){:target="_blank"} about the conference, as well as the [video](https://www.dotconferences.com/2019/12/adria-fontcuberta-the-pragmatic-front-end-tester){:target="_blank"} of the actual talk), tests give predictability and
"help us sleep well at night".

In this blog post, I'll show you useful hints for unit testing a simple component in React.

## Getting started

One of the most recent features we've introduced in the storefront of ePages shops is a way to simply load more results on search and product category pages by clicking on a new "Load more" button.
We could draft here a simplified version of this feature, and carry on to writing tests for it!
This will help us to understand how tests work and how to ensure our tests are making our code reliable and predictable.

We could start with a simple component including a button which can fetch (via an API) a fixed amount of, say, 1 product, and stores them in its state in order to subsequently display it.
Our first shot could be:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Product = (product) => (
  <li>
    <h3>{product.id}</h3>
    <p>{product.name}</p>
    <p>{product.price}</p>
  </li>
)

const fetchProducts = (page) => fetch(`http://localhost/products?page=${page}`).then(response => response.json())

export const ProductList = () => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([])
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1)
  const loadProducts = async () => {
    const response = await fetchProducts(page)
    if (response) {
      const newProducts = response.products
      setProducts(products.concat(newProducts))
      setPage(page + 1)
    }
  }
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ul>
        {products.map(product => <Product {...product} />)}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={loadProducts}>
       Load more!
      </button>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

export default ProductList
```

I've prepared a [sample repository](https://github.com/DanielHara/unit-testing-react){:target="_blank"} for you on GitHub to try out all the code in this post.

## Let's test it!

Now comes the question, how would you test the component `ProductList`?

Here at ePages we use extensively the libraries [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library){:target="_blank"} and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/){:target="_blank"} to write our unit tests.
The former contains lots of useful features, like querying for HTML elements and firing all the events the user can trigger, while the latter provides us with a thorough mocking and assertion library.
As soon as I'm done writing the first lines of the tests, I imagine that my first test case would be to try to find a button to load some products:

```jsx
import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react'

it('should render a button to load products', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<ProductList />)

  const loadMoreButton = getByText('Load more!')
  fireEvent.click(loadMoreButton)
})
```

But, now, what should I expect?
I do not know what some external API will return me.
Maybe it is temporarily down.
There comes an important notion of testing: you must decouple your tests from other dependencies as much as possible.
After all, are you testing just `ProductList` or also an external API?

## Mock it

Jest offers you the possibility of mocking all kinds of functions, including their return values, and asserting how many times they were called, and with which arguments.
It also offers a great deal of syntactic sugar to make your tests look pretty and for you to admire them after they've been written.

Maybe we could mock `fetchProducts` to take a look on whether it was called with the right arguments, and also mock the return value, to assert whether the `ProductList` is rendering them correctly.
This way our tests become a lot more predictable.

However... Can it easily be done?
It's difficult to mock `fetchProducts`, because you'd have to override the `ProductList.jsx` file.
Here comes another hint: try to inject your external dependencies such that you can mock them!
You could pass `fetchProducts` as a prop instead:

```jsx
const defaultFetchProducts = (page) => fetch(`http://localhost/products?page=${page}`).then(response => response.json())


const ProductList = ({ fetchProducts = defaultFetchProducts }) => {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([])
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1)
  const loadProducts = async () => {
    const response = await fetchProducts(page)
    if (response) {
      const newProducts = response.products
      setProducts(products.concat(newProducts))
      setPage(page + 1)
    }
  }
  return (
    <>
      <ul>
        {products.map(product => <Product {...product} />)}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={loadProducts}>
       Load more!
      </button>
    </>
  )
}

export default ProductList
```

And what about the test?

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react'
import ProductList from '../ProductList'
import Bluebird from 'bluebird'
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils'

it('should render a button to load products', async () => {
  const fetchProducts = jest.fn().mockImplementation((page) => Promise.resolve({
    products: [{
      id: `dummy-id-${page}`,
      name: 'dummy-product',
      price: '10 Â£'
    }]
  }))

  const { getByText } = render(<ProductList fetchProducts={fetchProducts} />)

  const loadMoreButton = getByText('Load more!')

  // click the first time
  fireEvent.click(loadMoreButton)
  await act(() => Bluebird.delay(500))

  // expect one product
  expect(getByText('dummy-id-1')).toBeTruthy()
  expect(fetchProducts).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(fetchProducts).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1)

  // click the second time
  fireEvent.click(loadMoreButton)
  await act(() => Bluebird.delay(500))

  // expect two products
  expect(getByText('dummy-id-1')).toBeTruthy()
  expect(fetchProducts).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)
  expect(fetchProducts).toHaveBeenCalledWith(2)
})
```

This test can already be taken seriously!
It checks whether we called `fetchProducts` with the right arguments and whether we use the result of these calls in a meaningful way.

In the example repository, you can find this approach on the branch `mocking-fetch-products`.

## Taking it to the next level

The former approach has, nevertheless, its drawbacks.
We rely completely on the mock of `fetchProducts`.
How can we know if it would hit the right API endpoints?
There's where the awesome [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock){:target="_blank"} library comes along.
You can also mock the HTTP requests!
Calling `nock('http://localhost')` will mock any requests made to `http://localhost` _inside_ our test!
This way, we also test that the right HTTP requests are being made and do not have to mock `fetchProducts` at all!

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { fireEvent, render } from '@testing-library/react'
import nock from 'nock'
import ProductList from '../ProductList'
import Bluebird from 'bluebird'
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils'

it('should render a button to load products', async () => {
  const scope = nock('http://localhost')
    .get('/products')
    .query({ page: 1 })
    .reply(200, {
      products: [{
        id: 'dummy-id-1',
        name: 'dummy-product-1',
        price: '10 Â£'
      }]
    })
    .get('/products')
    .query({ page: 2 })
    .reply(200, {
      products: [{
        id: 'dummy-id-2',
        name: 'dummy-product-2',
        price: '20 Â£'
      }]
    })

  const { getByText } = render(<ProductList />)

  const loadMoreButton = getByText('Load more!')

  fireEvent.click(loadMoreButton)
  await act(() => Bluebird.delay(500))

  // expect one product
  expect(getByText('dummy-id-1')).toBeTruthy()

  fireEvent.click(loadMoreButton)
  await act(() => Bluebird.delay(500))

  // expect two products
  expect(getByText('dummy-id-1')).toBeTruthy()
  expect(getByText('dummy-id-2')).toBeTruthy()

  scope.done()
})
```

You can try this out on the `master` branch of the example repository.

Now, we actually test that the endpoint `/products` has been hit with query params `page=1` and `page=2`, thanks to the `scope.done()` call, which is an awesome feature of Nock!
It asserts that all of the mocked API endpoint calls have been hit!
And, furthermore, this tests the component's feature independently of its implementation (so called 'black-box testing').
It does not matter for the test, for instance, how the `page` parameter is stored in the component.
This makes it a lot easier when the need for _refactoring_ comes.

## Conclusion

Nowadays, there is absolutely no reason why you should not unit test your code.
With so many great tools out there, the effort of writing tests absolutely pays off by dramatically decreasing the probability of inserting bugs and getting you covered when refactoring.  ðŸŽ‰
